/*
 * src/eval/bc/stencils/abi.h
 *
 * Copy-and-patch stencil immediate ABI.
 *
 * Each stencil source is compiled as a standalone .o file; the resulting
 * machine code is memcpy'd into RWX memory at runtime. Stencils reference
 * extern symbols declared here for the immediate operands the JIT patches:
 *
 *   MINO_STENCIL_IMM_A   -- A field of the bytecode instruction (8 bits)
 *   MINO_STENCIL_IMM_B   -- B field                              (8 bits)
 *   MINO_STENCIL_IMM_C   -- C field                              (8 bits)
 *   MINO_STENCIL_IMM_BX  -- Bx field (constant / ic-slot index, 16 bits)
 *   MINO_STENCIL_IMM_SBX -- signed Bx (branch offset)
 *
 * The compiler emits address-of expressions for these symbols; the linker
 * leaves the address fields unresolved as relocations. The extractor
 * records each relocation as (offset, kind, sym_index, addend) so the
 * runtime knows which bytes to overwrite when materialising the stencil
 * for a particular bytecode instruction.
 *
 * The address-of read is wrapped in IMM_* macros so the stencil sources
 * stay readable: `regs[IMM_A]` reads as a 1-D register access while the
 * underlying expression is `(unsigned long)(uintptr_t)&MINO_STENCIL_IMM_A`.
 *
 * No mino runtime headers are included here. Stencil sources are
 * intentionally hermetic so the build pipeline doesn't bring in compiler
 * options or symbol references that would muddy the emitted code.

;; Bit-syntax destructure macro.
;;
;; let-bits binds a sequence of segments from a bytes value at running
;; bit offsets. Each segment is a vector starting with a symbol and
;; followed by keyword/value option pairs matching the bits-get
;; surface (:size, :type, :endian, :signed?). The final segment with
;; :type :bytes and no explicit :size binds the bit-aligned remainder.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;;   (let-bits [packet
;;              [a :size 16]
;;              [b :size 32 :endian :little]
;;              [tail :type :bytes]]
;;     (println a b (count tail)))
;;
;; The macro expands into a (let ...) form whose body is the macro
;; arguments after the binding vector.

(defn- defrecord-bind-fields-in-method
  "Wraps a protocol method body so the record's field names are
   visible as locals bound to (get this :field). Matches Clojure
   defrecord's contract: in (defrecord R [a b] IFoo (bar [this] a)),
   `a` resolves to (:a this) inside the method body.

   Returns the method form unchanged if it doesn't look like a
   method spec (`(symbol [vec] body...)`), so protocol-name
   separators inside specs pass through. Bypasses wrapping when
   there are no fields. Skips binding for fields whose name shadows
   the method's first param (i.e. the dispatching `this` slot).

   Order of bindings inside the let preserves the field declaration
   order so later fields can reference earlier ones if a user shadows
